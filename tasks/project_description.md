# Project Description: Satellite-Based Wildfire Detection and Monitoring

## 1. Introduction

This project aims to leverage satellite imagery and machine learning techniques for the detection, monitoring, and assessment of wildfires. Satellite remote sensing offers a unique capability for large-scale, continuous observation, crucial for understanding wildfire dynamics, supporting early warning systems, and aiding post-disaster response and recovery efforts.

## 2. Project Goals

The primary goals of this project are:

*   **Develop a Robust Data Integration Pipeline:** Integrate multi-source satellite data (e.g., optical, thermal) with meteorological data to create a comprehensive dataset for wildfire analysis.
*   **Implement and Evaluate Machine Learning Models:** Design, train, and evaluate machine learning models (e.g., CNNs, U-Net, Transformers) for:
    *   Automated wildfire detection.
    *   Estimation of burned area.
    *   Assessment of burn severity.
*   **Develop Lightweight and Explainable Models:** Investigate and implement techniques to create computationally efficient (lightweight) models and integrate Explainable AI (XAI) methods to understand model predictions, focusing on resource-constrained scenarios.
*   **Interactive Analysis and XAI Tools:** Create Jupyter notebooks and potentially a simple dashboard for interactive data exploration, visualization, model result interpretation, and showcasing XAI insights.
*   **Focus on Wildfires:** While the broader context is disaster management, this project will specifically focus on wildfire events.

## 3. Scope

*   **Data Sources:** Primarily Sentinel-2 (optical), NASA FIRMS (active fire/thermal anomalies), and ERA5 (weather data).
*   **Geographic Focus:** Initially, specific regions known for wildfire activity (e.g., California, Australia, Mediterranean). This can be adjusted based on data availability and specific case studies.
*   **Machine Learning Tasks:**
    *   Image segmentation for burned area mapping.
    *   Classification for active fire detection.
    *   Potentially, time-series analysis for fire spread prediction.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   A curated and preprocessed dataset for wildfire analysis.
    *   Trained machine learning models.
    *   Jupyter notebooks for data processing, model training, and visualization.
    *   A final project report summarizing methodology, results, and future work.

## 4. Key Technologies and Methodologies

*   **Satellite Remote Sensing:**
    *   **Optical:** Sentinel-2 for high-resolution land cover mapping, burn scar identification, and vegetation indices (NDVI, NBR).
    *   **Thermal:** NASA FIRMS (MODIS, VIIRS) for active fire detection and hotspot localization.
*   **Geographic Information Systems (GIS):** For spatial data processing, analysis, and visualization.
*   **Data Processing:** Python libraries such as `rasterio`, `geopandas`, `xarray`, `numpy`, `pandas`.
*   **Earth Engine:** Google Earth Engine for large-scale geospatial data access and preprocessing.
*   **Machine Learning:**
    *   Frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow/Keras.
    *   Models: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), U-Net (for segmentation), potentially Vision Transformers.
    *   Libraries: `scikit-learn`, `segmentation-models-pytorch`.
*   **Development Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks, Python IDEs (e.g., VS Code).
*   **Explainable AI (XAI) and MLOps:** Google Cloud Vertex AI for model training, deployment, and generating feature attributions (e.g., Integrated Gradients, XRAI).

## 5. Potential Challenges

*   **Data Availability and Quality:** Cloud cover in optical imagery, spatial and temporal resolution limitations.
*   **Data Integration:** Aligning and fusing data from different sensors with varying characteristics.
*   **Ground Truth Data:** Availability of accurate ground truth data for model training and validation can be a significant challenge.
*   **Model Generalization:** Ensuring models perform well across different geographic regions and fire regimes.
*   **Computational Resources:** Processing large volumes of satellite data and training complex ML models can be computationally intensive.
